Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree - Project 2: Landing Page

My project is the homepage of a bakery that offers delicious cookies.

The objective is to show basic knowledge of Javascript by making a homepage interactive. This entails a navbar being built dynamically. Also the sections need to light up to show which one of them is currently being viewed by the user. When navigating the sections per click, the scroll there needs to be smooth, instead of the default jump.
